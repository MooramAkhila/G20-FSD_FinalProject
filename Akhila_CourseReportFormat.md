| Final Project: [I developed the SureTrust website using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The project involves building a full-stack web application where React.js is used for the front-end development, Express.js and Node.js handle the back-end API, and MongoDB is used as the database for storing and managing data. The website includes features like user authentication, data management, and dynamic content rendering]     | [https://github.com/MooramAkhila/G20-FSD_FinalProject.git]                         |
